# Solution Files
Test cases are split up into two parts. First is a solution file that has a correct implementation for a given function. It should be located in `code/grader/solutions/Assignment#/filename_solution.py` (where filename is whatever the filename the students are using is, and solution is the word solution). Any functions inside should match the name/ signature the students used. E.g. for a student file named windchill in Assignment 1, the path would be `code/grader/solutions/Assignment1/windchill_solution.py`. 

There is no need to have any of the testing code in the file. In fact it would be preferrable to have nothing outside of the functions themselves (unless it's a global variable or something).
