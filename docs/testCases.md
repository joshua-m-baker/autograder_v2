# Testing

The first part is a solution file, detailed [here](./solutionFiles.md)

The second part is an input file. It should be located in `grader/testValues/Assignment#.py` and contain a python dictionary named `tests`. The first key should be the module name the students use, the second key should be the function name, and the value should be a list of inputs. Since it is a python file, you can write functions outside the dictionary and call them there to generate values.
